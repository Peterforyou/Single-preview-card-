## Overview
This is a task from Frontend Mentor to build a Single Price-Grid-Component to aid my proficiency in learning CSS Grid.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the repeat attribute in the grid-template-column and the 1fr to make your work little stressful to grid instead of giving each column a precise pixel size which is cumbersome doing such.

```html
   <div class="box2">

   </div>
```
```css
 .box2 {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
 }
```

### Continued development    

I would love to focus more on css animation, transition and transform properties to aid my proficiency in building eye catchy projects.
